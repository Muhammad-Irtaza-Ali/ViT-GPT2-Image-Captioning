## 🖼️ **Image Captioning using ViT-GPT2**
This project demonstrates **image captioning** using **Vision Transformer (ViT) and GPT-2**, a transformer-based model that generates textual descriptions of images. The model is fine-tuned to describe images effectively using natural language.

---

### 📌 **Project Features**
- **Image Preprocessing**: Converts images into pixel values for the model.
- **ViT Feature Extraction**: Extracts meaningful visual representations.
- **GPT-2 Text Generation**: Generates coherent captions.
- **Beam Search Optimization**: Enhances caption quality.
- **Gradio Interface**: Provides an interactive UI for uploading images.

---

### 🚀 **Technologies Used**
- **Python**  
- **Hugging Face Transformers**  
- **PyTorch**  
- **Gradio (for interactive UI)**  
- **PIL (for image handling)**

### 📂 **How to Use**
#### 1️⃣ **Install Required Libraries**
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. If not, run:
```bash
pip install transformers torch gradio pillow
```

#### 2️⃣ **Download Model & Feature Extractor**
```python
from transformers import VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTFeatureExtractor, AutoTokenizer

model = VisionEncoderDecoderModel.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")
feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")
```

#### 3️⃣ **Run the Script**
Execute the script and upload an image to generate a caption.

---

### 📊 **Sample Output**
```
🔹 Generated Caption: "A dog sitting on a couch with a blanket."
```
The model successfully identifies the objects and actions in the image.

---

### 🛠 **Future Enhancements**
- **Fine-tuning on Custom Datasets** for improved captioning.
- **Multilingual Captioning** using transformer-based translation.
- **Integration with OCR** to describe text-based images.
