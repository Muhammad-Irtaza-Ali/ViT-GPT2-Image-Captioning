# Image Captioning with ViT-GPT2

## Overview
This repository explores **image captioning**, a task that bridges computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) by generating textual descriptions of images. This capability is essential for various applications such as accessibility, content organization, and automated image understanding.

## Ways of Image Captioning
There are multiple approaches to image captioning, each leveraging different machine learning techniques:

1. **CNN + RNN-Based Models**: Traditional image captioning models use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image feature extraction and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)** for generating captions. These models capture spatial features but struggle with long-range dependencies.

2. **Transformer-Based Models**: Modern approaches replace RNNs with **Transformers**, which process sequences in parallel, leading to more fluent and coherent captions. The **ViT-GPT2 model** falls under this category, combining a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for feature extraction and **GPT-2** for text generation.

3. **Diffusion Models & Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: Recent advancements incorporate **diffusion models** and **vision-language models** (such as CLIP) that enhance captioning by aligning image and text representations more effectively.

## Why Choose ViT-GPT2 for Image Captioning?

We selected **ViT-GPT2** for this task because:
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** effectively captures image representations without relying on convolutional layers, making it robust to different image variations.
- **GPT-2** is a powerful language model capable of generating natural and contextually rich captions.
- **Pre-trained on Large Datasets**, reducing the need for extensive custom training.
- **Hugging Face support** provides easy access to the model and tools for customization.
- **Gradio Interface Integration**, making it more user-friendly by providing an interactive way to generate image captions.
- **Code Optimization**, refining the implementation to make it more efficient and clean.

## Important Terms Related to Image Captioning
To better understand image captioning, it's essential to be familiar with the following concepts:

1. **Feature Extraction**: The process of obtaining useful visual representations from an image, typically done using CNNs or Transformers like ViT.
2. **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into smaller units (tokens) for input into language models.
3. **Beam Search**: A search algorithm that generates multiple caption candidates and selects the best one.
4. **Fine-Tuning**: Adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset by additional training.
5. **Self-Attention**: A mechanism in Transformers that allows the model to weigh different parts of the input when making predictions.
6. **Cross-Attention**: Enables interaction between visual and textual modalities, allowing the model to align image features with language generation.

## Best Datasets for Image Captioning
